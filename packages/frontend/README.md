# Wafrn

This project is the frontend of [wafrn](https://app.wafrn.net), the social network that respects you.

This is made with angular. Have fun doing stuff ;D

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This project uses npm. You can check that npm is installed in the terminal by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

### Setup

First, [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

Once the prerequisites are installed and you are working off the fork, [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
to your local machine.

This can be done from the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR USERNAME HERE]/wafrn.git ./wafrn
```

When the server is set up, you should get a success message:
